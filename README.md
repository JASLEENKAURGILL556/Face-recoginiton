# Face-recoginiton

# The proposed project is a combination of two technologies, namely face recognition and speech recognition. The goal of the project is to recognize faces in an image and draw a square around the identified face. The project takes input in the form of speech from the user, and based on the user's voice instruction, it identifies the person in the image.

 #To accomplish this task, the project uses face recognition algorithms to analyze the image and identify faces present in the picture. Once a face is detected, the project draws a square around it to highlight the identified area. Additionally, the project also utilizes speech recognition technology to receive user input in the form of voice instructions.

#To implement this project, a microphone or other audio input device is required to capture the user's voice instructions. The input is then processed by the speech recognition module, which converts the speech into text. The resulting text is then parsed and interpreted to identify the user's intent and extract relevant information.

#Using the information extracted from the user's instructions, the face recognition algorithm analyzes the image to identify the person of interest. If the person is found, the project draws a square around their face, indicating their location in the image.

#Overall, this project is a useful combination of two powerful technologies that can be used in a variety of applications. By combining face recognition and speech recognition, the project enables users to interact with images in a natural and intuitive way, improving the overall user experience.
